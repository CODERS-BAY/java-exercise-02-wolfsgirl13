## Name:
## Github username:
Your task is to implement a program that is able to perform basic calculations. It is not necessary to read any input. The output should be printed out with ``System.out``.

Try out the following types of calculations:

* &#x2b;
* &#x2212;
* &#xd7;
* &#xf7;
* &#x25; can you guess what this does operator does?

You **must** use at least two variables of every datatype. For example: ``x + y``. It is of course possible to use more variables, this is up to you.
Make two implementations of the program, one with integers and another one with floating point numbers. What is the difference?

**NOTE**: You can type everything statically in one main function.
